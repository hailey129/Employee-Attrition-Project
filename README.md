# Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

**Overview**
* This project focuses on analysing employee attrition linked with the healthcare sector using a real-world dataset. By leveraging statistical modeling techniques and optimisation tools, I identified key factors influencing attrition and proposed actionable strategies to improve employee retention and reduce workforce disruptions.

**Objectives**
* Understand the underlying factors contributing to employee attrition.
* Build a predictive model using logistic regression to classify employees likely to leave.
* Use optimisation tools to explore potential strategies for improving retention.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to enhance employee satisfaction and stability.

**Dataset**
* IBM HR Dataset 
* Contains 35 attributes, including demographics, job role, performance metrics, and satisfaction levels.

**Methodology**

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

*  Handled missing values and outliers.
*  Encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

*  Performed data exploration using Python and R, generating visualizations to identify key trends and correlations.
*  Visualized attrition rates across critical factors such as job satisfaction, overtime, and salary levels.

**Statistical Modeling:**

 Built a logistic regression model in Python to predict attrition with 93% accuracy.
 
 Evaluated the model using precision, recall metrics based on the classification table reports.
 
 Optimisation with Gurobi:

* Used Python Gurobi to optimise retention strategies, exploring scenarios such as budget allocation for wellness programs and flexible work initiatives.

**Recommendations:**

Proposed strategies like wellness programs and flexible work arrangements, projected to reduce attrition rates from 16% to 10%.

**Key Findings:**

* Employees with low job satisfaction and frequent overtime are at a higher risk of attrition.
* Implementing targeted retention strategies can significantly reduce attrition rates and improve workforce stability.

**Tools and Technologies:**
* **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Gurobi.
* **R**: ggplot2, dplyr for generating visualizations and additional statistical analysis.
* Jupyter Notebook and RStudio for development and reporting.

**Results:**
* Achieved 93% accuracy with the logistic regression model.
* Optimised retention strategies using Gurobi, providing actionable insights for improving workforce stability.
* Delivered visualisations in Python and R to highlight critical factors influencing attrition.
